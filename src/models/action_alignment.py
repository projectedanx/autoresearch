    Differentiable Action-Alignment Loss (Regret Minimization) Module in PyTorch.

    Bridges the 'thought-action' gap by mathematically penalizing the agent's policy
    (Head B) if it deviates from the optimal Best Response calculated based on its
    descriptive prediction of the opponent's strategy (Head A).

    payoff_matrix (Tensor): Float tensor of shape (num_agent_actions, num_opponent_actions)
                            representing the utility values for the agent.
    use_smooth (bool): If True, applies log-sum-exp (Boltzmann) to compute the
                       oracle expected utility, ensuring dense gradient flow.
    temperature (float): Scaling factor (tau) for the smooth best-response calculation.
